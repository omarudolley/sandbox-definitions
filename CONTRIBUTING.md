## Getting Started

New definitions should be submitted as a pull request to this repository. We try our
best to provide an automated validation of the most common mistakes in the definitions
format, but it's still better to go through the definition guidelines.

## Definitions format

The most complete set of rules with examples can be found in the
[DataProducts](./DataProducts/README.md) directory. Except of that, please make sure to
meet the following criterias:

1. Use American English for describing data
2. Each definition file must define only one POST endpoint
3. Each definition file must include a schema for a successful response
4. Each definition file must include a schema for the request body
5. Each definition file must not define any severs or security sections

## Adding new Data Product Definition

### Definition as a Python file

Definitions are created using Python and a set of
[pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) models. The converter from the
[ioxio-data-product-definition-tooling](https://github.com/ioxio-dataspace/ioxio-data-product-definition-tooling)
takes care of converting each `.py` file to the corresponding `.json` OpenAPI spec file.

For example, to add a definition for `Foo/Bar` version `0.1.0`:

- create `src/Foo/Bar_v0.1.py`

You have 2 options to use the converter:

1. By running `pre-commit install` after cloning the repo. Then definitions will be
   converted automatically before each commit (recommended).
2. By creating a PR to the `main` branch. CI workflow will run the automation and push
   updated/generated files if needed.

### Test version of definitions

Everyone can submit to this repo whatever definitions they seem appropriate. It will
allow to create data products using these definitions in a dataspace and experiment with
the system. In order to do this:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create your definitions under `src/test/<your_github_username>/`
3. Submit a PR and wait for CI Workflow to run and validate the changes
4. Once PR is merged, it's possible to use the definitions in the dataspace

### Versioning of definitions

#### Test definitions

Definitions in `src/test/<your_github_username>/` should not have any version number in
the filename and the version in the file needs to be of the form `0.0.x`. Each change to
the definition should increment the version by one. Examples of `version` -> `filename`:

- `0.0.1` -> `src/test/<your_github_username>/Foo/Bar.py`
- `0.0.2` -> `src/test/<your_github_username>/Foo/Bar.py`
- `0.0.3` -> `src/test/<your_github_username>/Foo/Bar.py`
- ...

#### Draft definitions

Definitions in `src/draft/` work the same way as the definitions in
`src/test/<your_github_username>/`. They are however being phased out on the dataspaces
where they still exist.

#### Other definitions

All other definitions have version numbers that are `>= 0.1.0` and they should follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

A general rule of thumb would be that the first definition should be versioned as
`0.1.0`. Any backward-compatible changes to it should increment the PATCH number (i.e.
`z` in `0.y.z`) and any breaking changes increment the MINOR number (i.e. increment `y`
in `0.y.z` and reset `z` to `0`).

Once the definition has been tested out a bit in practice and can be considered stable a
`1.0.0` version should be created. As per normal Semantic Versioning rules, any trivial
changes that does not break anything (for example fixing a typo in a description that
does not affect the data being transferred) should update the PATCH version, any new
backwards compatible functionality (like adding a new optional field) should update the
MINOR version and any breaking changes (like renaming a field or adding a new required
field) should increment the MAJOR version number (i.e. `1.2.3` -> `2.0.0`).

The version number in the definitions are reflected in the filenames and the URL path to
the data product. In the filename and URL the version is added to the end and separated
by `_v`, followed by the `MAJOR.MINOR` part of the version number. The `.PATCH` part is
left out as those changes are not allowed to change anything in the actual data format.
Any possible pre-release identifiers are included though. For example version `1.2.3` of
the `Foo/Bar` definition would correspond to the file `src/Foo/Bar_v1.2.py` and will be
requested from a URL of the form `/Foo/Bar_v1.2`.

Note that each time the MINOR version is updated the file is changed in place and when
the MAJOR or MINOR version number is updated a new definition file is created. At the
same time the definitions in the previous files are usually marked as deprecated. The
deprecation rules and deletion of old definitions can vary per dataspace.

Example of a typical flow of versions and corresponding filenames:

- `0.1.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v0.1.py` The first version.
- `0.1.1` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v0.1.py` Fix a typo in a title or description.
- `0.2.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v0.2.py` Add an optional or required field or rename a field.
- `0.2.1` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v0.2.py` Fix a typo in a title or description.
- `1.0.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v1.0.py` First stable release.
- `1.0.1` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v1.0.py` Fix a typo in a title or description.
- `1.1.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v1.1.py` Add a new optional field.
- `2.0.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v2.0.py` Rename a field or add a new required field.
- `3.0.0-beta` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v3.0-beta.py` Major rewrite of the whole definition
  structure that needs to be tested before being considered ready to be used.
- `3.0.0-beta.2` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v3.0-beta.2.py` Changes to data being transferred.
- `3.0.0` -> `src/Foo/Bar_v3.0.py` Final new version of the definition.
